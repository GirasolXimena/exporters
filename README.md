[Supernova](https://supernova.io/) allows you to generate production code out of your design systems with ease. You'll find all available exporters - packages that control how the code gets exported to your codebase - in this repository. For tutorials how to work with the exporters or even build your own, see our [developer docs](https://developers-next.supernova.io).

## Getting Started

Few resources to help you get started:

- Watch ["building your first exporter" video](https://tbd.com/) to learn how to build and modify them
- Read [developer documentation](https://developers-next.supernova.io) for all the details you might need
- Learn by example by going through the exporters [we've built for you](./exporters)
- Join our [Slack community](https://community.supernova.io/) to talk about any of this with Supernova team and your fellow developers
